**HTML**

HTML is used to structure the content in a semantic and organized way, making it easy to understand and maintain.


**CSS**

CSS is left empty to allow for complete customization of the design. This approach is chosen to provide flexibility, as the design can vary widely based on the project's requirements.


**JavaScript**

JavaScriptis used to handle user interactions and dynamic updates of selected chocolates and the total price. It ensures a responsive and interactive user experience.


Overall, this approach follows best practices for web development by separating structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript). It also provides room for customization, making it adaptable to different design requirements.
